## system ## 
Proxy for dlls located in the windows system directory (C:\Windows\System32)

## local ## 
Proxy for dlls located in the game directory (e.g. SMACKW32.DLL, BINKW32.DLL, ...)

Note: 
For local dlls you must append a "x" to the filename of the original dll: "SMACKW32.DLL" -> "SMACKW32x.DLL"
Place both, your proxy "SMACKW32.DLL" and the renamed original dll "SMACKW32x.DLL" into the game directory
